ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gianna

I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Surrey.

- ðŸŽ® Hobbies: In my free time, I enjoy gaming, particularly Nintendo titles, and challenging myself with speedcubing (currently working on improving my Rubikâ€™s cube time). I'm also passionate about exploring new tech and staying up-to-date with the latest innovations.
